<h1>Part 4</h1>

    You are given an input file containing N lines.

    Each line consists of a sequence of binary digits (0 and 1) separated by commas.

    Each line represents an independent binary array.

    Your task is to analyze every line and compute a global result according to the following rule:

    For each line:

        Find the maximum number of consecutive 1s that appear contiguously in that line.

        Store this value.

        After processing all lines, sum these maximum values from all lines.

        The final sum is the answer to the puzzle.

<h3>Example</h3>
    Input:
        1,0,1,1,0,0
        1,0,1,1,1,1

    Explanation:

    Line 1 → longest 1 sequence is 1,1 → length = 2

    Line 2 → longest 1 sequence is 1,1,1,1 → length = 4

    Final result: 2 + 4 = 6

<h3>Output</h3>
Compute the sum of the longest consecutive 1s from all lines.

Submit the final number for Puzzle 4.
