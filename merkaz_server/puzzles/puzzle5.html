<h1>Part 5</h1>

    You are given an input file containing N lines.

    Each line consists of five comma-separated fields:

        A, B, C, D, OP

    Where:
        A, B, C, D are 8-bit binary numbers (only 0 and 1).
        OP is one of these arithmetic operators: + , - , * 

    Each line represents a coordinate calculation.

    Your task is to process every line and generate a 2D drawing according to the following rules:

    For each line:

        Convert A, B, C, D from binary to decimal.

        Compute:
            X = A OP B
            Y = C OP D

        The pair (X, Y) represents a point on a 2D grid.

    After processing all lines:

        Create a 20 X 20 grid initialized with zeros.

        For every (X, Y) point, set grid[Y][X] = 1.

        The grid will form a hidden symbol.

    Your goal is to identify the symbol drawn in the grid.

<h3>Example</h3>

    Input:
        00000101,00000011,00001000,00000010,+

    Binary to decimal:
        A = 5
        B = 3
        C = 8
        D = 2

    Operation:
        X = 5 + 3 = 8
        Y = 8 + 2 = 10

    So the point (8, 10) is marked as 1 in the grid.

    If another line produces:
        (9,10) and (10,10)

    Then row 10 would contain:
        ...0111...

<h3>Output</h3>

    After drawing all points, a symbol (digit or letter) will appear.

    Submit the detected symbol for Puzzle 5.
