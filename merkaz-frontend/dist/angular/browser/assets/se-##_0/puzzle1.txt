/* Hello curious human! */

YOU FOUND A PUZZLE. TO SOLVE IT:

1. You will receive input lines, each containing THREE GROUPS OF NUMBERS separated by hyphens.
   Example:
     123-456-789
     321-654-987

2. For each number in the line, REVERSE its digits.
   Example:
     123 -> 321
     456 -> 654
     789 -> 987

3. For each line, SUM the reversed numbers.
   Example:
     321 + 654 + 987 = 1962
     123 + 456 + 789 = 1368

4. After all lines, SUM all the line results to get the FINAL TOTAL.
   Example:
     1962 + 1368 = 3330

INPUT METHOD:
- To get your input type 20202.

OUTPUT:
- A single number: the total sum of all lines.

GOOD LUCK!
